# Govind Assignment Solution

## Implementation Details
This solution implements [describe functionality]. The approach involves [describe logic and algorithm used].

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Govind-assignment-solution.git
   cd Govind-assignment-solution

Implementation Details and Approach
Logic and Algorithms Used:

1.CSS Flexbox for Layout:
The flex class ensures the images are arranged dynamically in rows and columns, adjusting to screen sizes.
The gap property spaces the images for aesthetic presentation.

2.Responsive Design:
Media queries handle different screen sizes:
Full-width images for mobile screens (max-width: 400px).
Adjust image sizes for tablets and desktops to fit multiple images in a row.

3.Smooth Hover Effects:
The transition property ensures the scale effect on hover is smooth (transform: scale(1.05)).

4.Animations:
Tailwind CSS's animate-pulse adds a pulsing animation to simulate a loading effect for images.

5.Code Organization:
CSS styles are defined in figma.css for maintainability.
React component (FigmaComponent) is used to render images dynamically with class names matching the CSS.

Usage Instructions
Steps to Run the Solution:
1.Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>


2.Install Dependencies:
Ensure Node.js is installed.
npm install

3.Add Images:
Place image files in the src/images/ directory as specified in the code.
Start the Application:
npm start
View in Browser:

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the responsive image layout.

Assumptions, Limitations, and Edge Cases
Assumptions:
Image files are stored in the src/images/ directory with the specified filenames (1.png, 2.png, etc.).
Browser support for modern CSS properties like flex, gap, and transition.
Limitations:
Images must have proper aspect ratios to avoid distortion, as no advanced cropping is handled.
Requires a modern browser for responsive behavior and animations.
The animate-pulse class might not render properly on older devices or browsers without Tailwind CSS support.
Edge Cases:
If an image is missing, the alt text will display, preventing broken layouts.
Handles small screen sizes gracefully using media queries.
Prevents overflow issues using overflow: hidden in the container.


Dependencies
1.Libraries/Tools Used:
React for component-based development.
Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS classes.
Node.js and npm for managing dependencies.
Installation Instructions:

2.Install Tailwind CSS:
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init


Additional Notes
Tips for Understanding Code:

image-container and responsive-image are the primary classes for layout and responsiveness.
Use the animate-pulse class to visually highlight loading states.
FAQs:

Q: What if an image doesn't load?
A: The alt text will be shown for better user experience.
Q: Can I add more images?
A: Yes, just place them in the src/images/ folder and update the JSX in FigmaComponent.
